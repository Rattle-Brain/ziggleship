# Ziggleship
A zig Battleship game. I tried making a very complex first project with Zig in [Tessera](https://github.com/Rattle-Brain/tessera) and I realized that actually writing anything in a brand new language can be a bit limiting, *so*, I decided to do this thing first to get familiar with Zig's syntax and stuff.

It's not particularly hard, but it takes some getting used to.

## Core features

As of now:
- It prints a board

Planned:
- Creation of ships
- User input interaction
- Variable board size, on start-up
- Socket ready to play multiplayer
- Singleplayer mode against the computer

None, do whatever you want. It's a well know game anyways.
